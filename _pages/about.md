🤓 I am a Machine Learning practitioner with experience working as a researcher focussed on Adversarial Machine Learning, Robustness and Safety.

💻 I am passionate about building scalable full stack machine learning enabled systems.

👨‍⚕️ My MSc thesis was on 'Fully Automated Hand Tracking for Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis' with a custom pose estimation model for tracking finger movements!

## Learning Publicly

In my experience so far, I discovered that it is far easier to learn and improve ML skills due to the abundance of blogs and online resources available.

Therefore, I am making an endeavour to publicly share projects that I complete and create online resources to help others learn ML in an intuitive and informative way.
